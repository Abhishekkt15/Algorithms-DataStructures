C Programs to Demonstrate Stacks using assertion

  1. Check balancing of symbols (like'{', '(', '[') and their order using stack.
  
  2. Evaluate postfix expression using stack. Example: Postfix expression is 6 5 2 3 + 8 * + 3 + * 
     
     Hint: When number is seen, it is pushed onto the stack; when an operator is seen, the operator is applied to the two numbers that are popped from the stack, and the result is      pushed onto the stack.
